# Random Shapes for ML Application

Just trying to create my own dataset and apply Machine learning models to correctly classify the handwritten shapes.
If you want the data, no problem.  You could've just `git clone` this anytime and you are ready to go. The data, it is still dirty tho which demands a lot of image preprocessing.
Once I master computer vision libraries and APIs, I'll update this repo for others to use it.
